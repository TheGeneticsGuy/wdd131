            <div class="topSec">
                <p>My name is Aaron Topping. I have been married for 15 years (since 2009), have 3 daughters, and I love
                    to code! I have been programming as a hobby for many years, but it was only after the success and
                    popularity of my most popular program that I was encouraged by others that I should try to make a
                    career out of it. So, here I am - A little older than the average college student, but completely
                    determined to make this work out. I look forward to all that I will learn, both on the front end,
                    the back end, and all of the gritty stuff inbetween.</p>

                <p>Arizona is a state in the Southewest region of the USA. It shares a border with California on
                    West, and Mexico on the bottom, New Mexico at the East, and Utah at the North. We are most known
                    for The Grand Canyon, amzing outdoor camping and hiking destinations at our National Parks, as
                    well as the famous Sonoran Desert featuring the tall Saguaro cacti. The state is also famous for
                    being the sunniest state in the country, with close to an average of 300 sunny days per year.
                    The capital of Arizona is the city of Phoenix.</p>
